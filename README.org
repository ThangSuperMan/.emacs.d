* Introduction
+ After a couple year using =Doom Emacs=, i'm finally switching back to a vanilla configuration! Because i got tired some framework getting in my way when i wanted to do stuff. I'm sure this is more applicable to =Doom Emacs= since the letter has nice macros written so easily add new packages and configure them.

#+begin_quote
Emacs is everything i need for a Good =text editor=.
#+end_quote

+ My Configuration is inspired by some people, some configuration different. So sometimes you can see this code somewhere on the internet. But I have edited a lot to suit my preferences, if you want to use them you should be reconfigure according to your personal preferences.

#+begin_src rust
fn main() {
    fn add() {}
}
#+end_src
